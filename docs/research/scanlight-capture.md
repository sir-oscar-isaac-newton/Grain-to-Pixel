# Scanlight V4 and camera capture

Decision: [ADR 0004](../../decisions/0004-guided-rgb-capture.md). Spec: [§6.1](../specification.md).

## Desk research (public docs, unverified on our hardware)
- Scanlight: https://github.com/jackw01/scanlight, control interface doc `automation/bsl_control_interface.md` (firmware 1.2). USB CDC serial, binary protocol (`0xFE`, header, length, data). Commands: SET_COLOR (0), GET_FW_VERSION (2), SHUTTER_PULSE (3), SET_FOCUS (7, PCB 26a902b only). Streams LED_TEMP and VBUS every 200 ms. No acks, no VID/PID.
- Shutter output is a 3.5 mm jack; needs a camera-specific cable; Nikon may need the focus signal. Pulse length is set per command.
- libgphoto2 tethering: D600 support not confirmed; macOS may claim the camera (Image Capture / PTP daemon).

## Spike checklist (to fill in)
- [ ] Scanlight PCB revision and firmware ID (`GET_FW_VERSION`)
- [ ] Serial port appears and opens on macOS and Windows 10/11 without extra drivers
- [ ] Each colour lights alone with `SET_COLOR` (save flag 0); switch latency; settle time needed
- [ ] `LED_TEMP` readings during a 3-colour sequence; sensible warn/abort limits
- [ ] D600 remote cable (already owned) on the 3.5 mm output: does it fire the shutter; is `SET_FOCUS` needed (rev B supports it)
- [ ] `SHUTTER_PULSE` length that reliably fires the D600 (default 100 ms)
- [ ] libgphoto2 on Apple Silicon: D600 listed? capture + download NEF? does macOS block USB access (how to release it)?
- [ ] Bundling libgphoto2 and its camera/port driver libraries inside the .app; env paths for driver dirs
- [ ] Windows: digiCamControl sees the D600, downloads NEFs fired by the Scanlight pulse into a session folder (without triggering captures itself); file-complete detection
- [ ] EXIF identical across the three shots; histogram/clipping check works on `rawler` output
- Result / recommendation:
